# Business Case: NIST 800-53 + PCI-DSS Cloud Security Project

## Purpose  
This project was designed to help organizations meet the rigorous security and compliance requirements defined by NIST 800-53 and PCI-DSS, especially when operating in a multi-cloud environment. It serves as a reusable security architecture and automation framework for teams responsible for safeguarding payment data and regulated workloads across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Business Problem  
Enterprises that process, store, or transmit cardholder data face compliance obligations under PCI-DSS. Additionally, organizations with federal or highly regulated contracts must adhere to NIST 800-53 control baselines. Ensuring these controls are met in a scalable, auditable, and automated way across cloud providers is a challenge, particularly when teams lack integrated tooling or consistent configurations.

## Solution  
This project introduces a Terraform-driven security deployment model that implements technical safeguards such as encryption, access control, logging, and vulnerability detection â€” mapped directly to NIST and PCI-DSS control objectives. The solution supports continuous compliance posture, simplifies audits, and reduces the risk of misconfigurations or human error.

## Value  
- Enhances audit readiness across multiple regulatory frameworks  
- Reduces the time and cost of quarterly PCI-DSS assessments  
- Provides consistent cloud security baselines across providers  
- Demonstrates architectural maturity and security automation skills  
- Aligns security implementation with business-driven compliance requirements

## Stakeholders  
- Security Architects  
- Compliance Teams  
- DevOps and Infrastructure Teams  
- Cloud Governance and Risk Officers
